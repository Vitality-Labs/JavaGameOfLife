# JavaGameOfLife
My version of John Conway's "Game of Life" program created in Java. In my version, rather than all "cells" competeing with eachother, I divided the "cells" into two teams. These teams then compete following the standard rules followed in Conway's with the addition of one rule, if the cell has contact with more than 1 hostile cell it will die.
